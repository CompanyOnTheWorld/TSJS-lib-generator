Open or refer to an issue in the [TypeScript repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript).\r\n1. Add missing elements to `inputfiles/addedTypes.json`, overriding elements to `inputfiles/overridingTypes.json`, or elements to remove to `inputfiles/removedTypes.json`.\r\n2. Run the script locally to obtain new `dom.generated.d.ts` and `webworker.generated.d.ts`.\r\n3. Update the files in the `baselines` folder using the newly generated files.\r\n\r\n## Code Structure\r\n\r\n- `Shared.fs`: handles the parsing from XML spec file, and stores the common data structures for later use.\r\n- `TS.fs`: handles the emitting of the `lib.d.ts` file.\r\n- `JS.fs`: handles the emitting of the `domWeb.js` and `domWindows.js`.\r\n\r\n## Input Files\r\n\r\n- `browser.webidl.xml`: an XML spec file generated by Microsoft Edge. **Do not edit this file**.\r\n    - Due to the different update schedules between Edge and TypeScript, this may not be the most up-to-date version of the spec.\r\n- `webworker.webidl.xml`: an XML spec file generated by Microsoft Edge that contains types for Web Workers. **Do not edit this file**.\r\n- `addedTypes.json`: types that should exist in either browser or webworker but are missing from the Edge spec. The type can be `property`, `method`, `interface`, `constructor`, or `indexer`.\r\n- `overridingTypes.json`: types that are defined in the spec file but has a better or more up-to-date definitions in the json files.\r\n- `removedTypes.json`: types that are defined in the spec file but should be removed.\r\n- `comments.json`: comment strings to be embedded in the generated .js files.\r\n- `jsTemplate.js`: the initial templates for `domWeb.js` and `domWindows.js`, which contains the necessary helper functions.\r\n- `sample.json`: sample json file used to tell F# json type provider that structure of the json files. The content of it is not used anywhere.\r\n",
